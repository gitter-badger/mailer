                        Add a new project and give it a name. For example, if this is for your personal portfolio, name it as Portfolio... When someone submits a form in your portfolio, you will get an email with the project name in the heading. <br data-brackets-id='1378'> So you can identify from which form the data was recieved.
                    </li>
                    <li data-brackets-id='1379' style="margin-top:20px;">
                        Add a redirect URL if you want. This is the URL of the page that you need the user to be sent after the form submission.
                        <br data-brackets-id='1380'> You can choose the default redirect, so that the user will be sent to a page generated by Mailer containing a 'success message'. User can press 'back' on browser to come back to the page with the form.
                        <br data-brackets-id='1381'> If you want the user to stay in the same page after form submission, enter the URL of that page as the redirect URL.
                    </li>
                    <li data-brackets-id='1382' style="margin-top:20px;">
                        Once you successfully added the project, a link will be generated and displayed under My Projects.
                        <br data-brackets-id='1383'> Insert that URL as the "action" attribute of the form tag and also add "method" attribute as "POST", and you are done!
                    </li>
                    <li data-brackets-id='1384' style="margin-top:20px;">
                        Whenever a user submits your form, you will recieve an email with form data and the Project name in the head and subject.
                    </li>
                    <li data-brackets-id='1385' style="margin-top:20px;">
                        You can remove your projects anytime you want and the URL generated for that project is permenently discarded. The same project link can not be regenerated for a new project.
                    </li>
